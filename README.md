### Objectives

1. Understand fundamentals of robotics, coordinate systems, transformations and orientation representations.
1. Learn forward and inverse kinematic functions and their application.
1. Learn Cartesian and kinematic robot planning methods
1. Apply these concepts to design and implement digital fabrication processes.
1. Gain an understanding of different robot control methods and their application.
1. Learn how to generate fabrication data for a (robotic) 3D printing process using a custom slicing method.

### Content

Lectures, tutorials and project-based exercises will focus on:

* Introduction to fundamentals of robotics.
* Introduction to COMPAS framework and core extensions for digital fabrication (fab, rrc, slicer)
* Robot model representations.
* Robot forward and inverse kinematics.
* Robot path planning: Cartesian motion planning and kinematic motion planning, planning scene and collision detection.
* Integration of planning tools into parametric design environment (CAD).
* Overview and usage of ROS (Robot Operating System).
* Design of digital fabrication processes (assembly of discrete elements, 3D printing, etc.).

## Requirements

* Minimum OS: Windows 10 Pro or Mac OS Sierra 10.12
* [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) Docker Toolbox would also work but it's a bit more annoying. After installation on Windows, it is required to enable "Virtualization" on the BIOS of the computer.
* [Rhino 6/7 & Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/download)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Any python editor works, but we recommend VS Code + extensions [as mentioned in our docs](https://gramaziokohler.github.io/compas_fab/latest/getting_started.html#working-in-visual-studio-code-1)

## Installation

We use `conda` to make sure we have clean, isolated environment for dependencies.

First time using `conda`? Make sure you run this at least once:

    (base) conda config --add channels conda-forge

Clone this repository and create a new conda environment:

    (base) cd path/to/COMPAS-II-FS2021
    (base) conda env create -f environment.yml
    (base) conda activate compas-fs2021

<details><summary>Alternatively, create environment manually</summary>
<p>

The conda environment can also be manually created:

    (base) conda create -n compas-fs2021 python=3.8 compas_fab>=0.16 --yes
    (base) conda activate compas-fs2021

</p>
</details>

**Mac**

Also install `python.app` after activating the environment:

    (compas-fs2021) conda install python.app

### Verify installation

    (compas-fs2021) python -m compas

    Yay! COMPAS is installed correctly!

    COMPAS: 1.1.0
    Python: 3.8.8 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 20 2021, 15:50:08) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]
    Extensions: ['compas-cgal', 'compas-fab', 'compas-slicer']

### Install on Rhino

    (compas-fs2021) python -m compas_rhino.install
    (compas-fs2021) python -m compas_rhino.install -v 7.0

### Update installation

To update your environment:

    (compas-fs2021) conda env update -f environment.yml
