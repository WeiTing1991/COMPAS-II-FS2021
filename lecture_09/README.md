# COMPAS II: Assembly of discrete elements III

Continued applied exercise from planning data to robot control for an assembly of discrete elements.  

## Examples

Some of these examples only work when connected to the ROS instance that was active during the lecture.

* Live demo of robotic assembly
  * [SCARA robot model using Grasshopper](01_define_scara_model.ghx)
  * [Joint state subscription](02_joint_state_subscribe.ghx)
  * [Assembly generation](03_assemblies.ghx)
  * [End-effector definition](04_tool.ghx)
  * [Assembly viewer](05_viewer.ghx)

* Control scripts
  * [Publish joint state to ROS](10_publish_joints.py)
  * [Single-brick placing example](99_brick_placing.py)
  * [Grasshopper assembly control example](99_control.ghx)
